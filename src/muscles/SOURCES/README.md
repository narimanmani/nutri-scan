# Muscle overlay assets

The SVG anatomy silhouettes and overlays bundled in this project are hand-drawn recreations that were designed to closely match the body regions exposed by the [wger Workout Manager](https://wger.de/) visuals.

The original wger overlays are distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0) license. Because the upstream CDN now blocks automated downloads (responses return `403 Forbidden`), the original vectors could no longer be mirrored verbatim inside the repository. To keep the workout planner fully offline-capable, we rebuilt simplified silhouettes and highlight shapes from scratch while preserving the anatomical intent of the wger artwork.

If you need the canonical illustrations, you can still request them from wger directly at:

- https://wger.de/static/images/muscles/main/muscle-<id>.svg
- https://wger.de/static/images/muscles/secondary/muscle-<id>.svg

The redraws included here are released under the same CC BY-SA 3.0 license to remain compatible with wger's requirements.
